EVTDESC4413218;It is no secret that America has a troubled history regarding the enslavement of Africans. There are those who would argue that only through providing African Americans with their own autonomous region will the wrongs of the country’s past be corrected. However, others assert that doing so would only isolate African Americans and fail to properly address their problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44132189;The next step in the formation of the New African autonomous region is establishing its borders. There are three possibilities of varying sizes, each larger than the last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4413220;In the names of anti-imperialism, communism, and self-determination, the People’s Union of New Africa has been formally established. Time will tell how the new nation will fare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4413221;In the recent years, New Africa has become a great power and one that, many argue, should expand. Plans have been drafted for liberation of workers of the rich sugar plantations dotted across the islands of the Caribbean. Although perhaps the destiny of New Africa rests in the lands of the American South where our enslaved ancestors once toiled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4413222;A recent effort has been made in New Africa to integrate the black and white population.  Although there is a disagreement as to what extent integration should be attempted. While it is agreeable to most for the extension of rights to Northern immigrants or so-called Yankees, there is a great deal of discomfort at the thought of extending rights to Southerners that once practiced slavery. No matter the choice, the far right elements are bound to protest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
