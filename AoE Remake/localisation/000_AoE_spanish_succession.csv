EVTNAME93000OPTB;Support a Habsburg heir;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC93000;In 1665 Charles II became the King of Spain, suffering from ill-health all his life, his death was anticipated almost from birth. It soon became apparent that the Spanish Habsburg line would die with him. As a result, his succession was hotly debated for decades. In 1670, England agreed to support the rights of Louis XIV to the Spanish throne in the Treaty of Dover, while the terms of the 1688 Grand Alliance committed England and the Dutch Republic to back Leopold from the house of Habsburg. In 1700, the Spanish Empire includes possessions in Italy, the Spanish Netherlands, the Philippines and the Americas and though no longer the dominant great power, it remains largely intact. Its acquisition by either the Austrian Habsburgs or French Bourbons would change the balance of power in Europe, and so its inheritance may lead to a war that involves most of the European powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
