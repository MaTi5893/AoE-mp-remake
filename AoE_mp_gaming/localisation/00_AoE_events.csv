EVTDESC173601;The Janissaries have started to protest against reforms imposed by our recently hired advisors from Prussia. If we don't do something about them, they may very well completely prevent us from making any progress towards modernizing our army!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC173602;The Janissaries have come before you, my sultan, demanding higher pay for war, arguing that it will motivate the troops, and that only an army with high moral can truly secure our victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC173603;Our soldiers looted, terrorized, and vandalized Vienna for three days, during which many Austrian and German works were either stolen or destroyed. The famous statues from the Founder's Vault were sent back to adorn the façade of Sultan's palace, where they remain. As well as being stolen, works of immeasurable artistic value were destroyed merely for their material value. One of the most precious works to suffer such a fate was Peterskirche. Like so many other priceless artworks made of bronze, the statue was melted down for its content by our soldiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC173605;The Turks are asking us to sent a delegation of military advisors, so they can modernize their military. They offer generous payment in return for our help, and sure enough, such an act will show the world how great and respected our military staff is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC156900;Since the formation of Ducal Prussia, many of our nobles are afraid of their potential betrayal, just like during the Swedish deluge. They have suggested making ducal Prussia an integral part of the Polish crown, what should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC156901;Our recent changes in taxation policies have made our nobles furious, a few days ago on the meeting of sejm, they have decided to protest against it! Arguing that under their status as "nobility", are entitled to lower taxes, they forget, however, just how dire the situation of our country is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC156902;The recent change in the balance of our estates has made our nobility very unhappy, using our militant population they managed to veto our policies to limit their influence in our kingdom. They have successfully restored all their previous privileges!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC156903;Today on meeting of sejm our nobility voted to cut our country's taxes in favor of extracting their own payment from their subjects  to support the war effort as well as repurposing some part of your personal treasury to fund necessary equipment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC156904;The general sejm is the bicameral parliament of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was established by the Union of Lublin in 1569 from the merger of the Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland and the Seimas of The Grand Duchies of Lithuania, Ruthenia and Samogitia. It is one of the primary elements of the democratic governance in the Commonwealth . The sejm is a powerful political institution and the king could not pass laws without the approval of that body. This however has lead to our downfall, we cannot properly function as a nation anymore, no effective policies can be carried out because of our incompetent nobility! There is only one solution to this problem - a forceful abolishment of our parliament!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mug_desc;With the support of the Islamic orthodoxy, a younger son of Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb (reigned 1658–1707), seized the throne. Aurangzeb defeated Dara in 1659 and had him executed. Although Shah Jahan fully recovered from his illness, Aurangzeb declared him incompetent to rule and had him imprisoned. During Aurangzeb's reign, the empire gained political strength once more and became the world's most powerful economy. Aurangzeb fully established Sharia by compiling the Fatwa Alamgiri. He expanded the empire to include almost the whole of South Asia, but at his death in 1707, "many parts of the empire were in open revolt". Aurangzeb is considered India's most controversial king with some historians arguing his religious conservatism and intolerance undermined the stability of Mughal society, while other historians question this, noting that he built Hindu temples, employed significantly more Hindus in his imperial bureaucracy than his predecessors did, opposed bigotry against Hindus and Shia Muslims, and married Hindu Rajput princess Nawab Bai. Without him we cannot effectively govern our empire anymore without resorting to granting more autonomy to different states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But who will lead us? who can provide all these things? Now that we're independent this question has been on everyone's mind. There are two viable options: A republic with a "president" as the head of state or a constitutional monarchy with a king at its lead;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC177503;By the beginning of 1770, there were 4,000 British soldiers in Boston, a city with 15,000 inhabitants, and tensions were running high. On the evening of March 5th, crowds of day laborers, apprentices, and merchant sailors began to pelt British soldiers with snowballs and rocks. A shot rang out, and then several soldiers fired their weapons. When it was over, five civilians lay dead or dying, including Crispus Attucks, an African American merchant sailor who had escaped from slavery more than twenty years earlier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC177504;The recent Tea act has sparked an immense number of protests all across the colonies. A group called "Sons of Liberty" has proposed a cunning plan to take revenge on the British for such stupid policies. They propose to disguise themselves as natives, and throw the nearest shipment of tea from The East India Company into the ocean. All they demand from us it to not condemn the actions after the event. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC177505;On Tuesday last the body of the people of this and all the adjacent towns, and others from the distance of twenty miles, assembled at the old south meeting-house, to inquire the reason of the delay in sending the ship Dartmouth, with the East-India Tea back to London and having found that the owner had not taken the necessary steps for that purpose, they enjoined him at his peril to demand of the collector of the customs a clearance for the ship, and appointed a committee of ten to see it performed, after which they adjourned to the Thursday following ten o’clock. They then met and being informed by Mr. Rotch, that a clearance was refused him, they encouraged him immediately to enter a protest and apply to the governor for a pass port by the castle, and adjourned again till three o’clock for the same day. At which time they again met and after waiting till near sunset Mr. Rotch came in and informed them that he had accordingly entered his protest and waited on the governor for a pass, but his excellency told him he could not consistent with his duty grant it until his vessel was qualified. The people finding all their efforts to preserve the property of the East India company and return it safely to London, frustrated by the tea consignees, the collector of the customs and the governor of the province, DISSOLVED their meeting.--- But, BEHOLD what followed! A number of brave and resolute men, determined to do all in their power to save their country from the ruin which their enemies had plotted, in less than four hours, emptied every chest of tea on board the three ships commanded by captains Hall, Bruce, and Coffin, amounting to 342 chests, into the sea!! without the least damage done to the ships or any other property. The masters and owners are well pleased that their ships are thus cleared, and the people are almost universally congratulating each other on this happy event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1754001;A prominent officer has been rising trough the ranks of our military, displays of great caution and strategic mind are all valuable to an effective military commander. A proposition have been made to grant this young lad the rank of general and have him among our greatest officers so we can strengthen our military force.x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC17860001;For a few weeks now our parliament has been fiercely debating over the question of our capital. Many proposition have been made, including New York, Charleston and Philadelphia. Choosing any of these cities will result in either southern or northern contempt, since it seem as if the federal government is favoring either southern or northern states. There has also been talk of building a new capital city, one set in a natural territory symbolizing a balance between all the states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC180500001;Louisiana is a territory which doesn't necessarily serve much purpose to us. Currently it is used to sustain our colony in Haiti. An idea has sprung among our government officials to sell it to the United States for a great price, so we can afford to fund our future wars. this would surely bring the significant boost to our economy we seek.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC180500002;Our French brethren have proposed a deal to us. For a small price of 2,000,000 dollars we may acquire their colony of Louisiana. This is an incredible opportunity for our young nation, we may finally make a significant expansion to the west, without losing a single life. We should consider this offer, though very tempting, the price is incredibly high and may put us in debt, the ultimate decision will be made by you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC180500003;The United states have agreed to our proposal and have sent us the appropriate sum of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Imposed a direct tax on the British colonies in America the "Stamp Act" requires many printed materials in the colonies to be produced on stamped paper produced in London, carrying an embossed revenue stamp. Printed materials included legal documents, magazines, playing cards, newspapers, and many other types of paper used throughout the colonies, and it had to be paid in British currency, not in colonial paper money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT177502DESC;In spite of the recent losses in our last war, the parliament has made decision to enact a new tariff on our American colonies, so we may safely recover from our economic downfall. The principal objective was to reduce the massive amount of tea held by the financially troubled British East India Company in its London warehouses and to help the financially struggling company survive. A related objective was to undercut the price of illegal tea, smuggled into Britain's North American colonies. This was supposed to convince the colonists to purchase Company tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, thus implicitly agreeing to accept Parliament's right of taxation. Smuggled tea was a large issue for Britain and the East India company, since approximately 86% of all the tea in America at the time was smuggled Dutch tea. The Act granted the Company the right to directly ship its tea to North America and the right to the duty-free export of tea from Britain, although the tax imposed by the Townshend Acts and collected in the colonies remained in force. It received the royal assent on May 10, 1773.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC170000;Peter's visits to the West impressed upon him the notion that European customs were in several respects superior to Russian traditions. He commanded all of his courtiers and officials to wear European clothing and cut off their long beards, causing his Boyard, who were very fond of their beards, great upset. Boyars who sought to retain their beards were required to pay an annual beard tax of one hundred rubles. Peter also sought to end arranged marriages, which were the norm among the Russian nobility, because he thought such a practice was barbaric and led to domestic violence, since the partners usually resented each other.In 1699 Peter changed the date of the celebration of the new year from 1 September to 1 January. Traditionally, the years were reckoned from the purported creation of the World, but after Peter's reforms, they were to be counted from the birth of Christ. Thus, in the year 7207 of the old Russian calendar, Peter proclaimed that the Julian Calendar was in effect and the year was 1700.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1700001;In the winter of 1723, Peter, whose overall health was never robust, began having problems with his urinary tract and bladder. In the summer of 1724 a team of doctors performed surgery releasing upwards of four pounds of blocked urine. Peter remained bedridden until late autumn. In the first week of October, restless and certain he was cured, Peter began a lengthy inspection tour of various projects. According to legend, in November, at Lakhta along the Finnish Gulf to inspect some ironworks, Peter saw a group of soldiers drowning near shore and, wading out into near-waist deep water, came to their rescue. This icy water rescue is said to have exacerbated Peter's bladder problems and caused his death. The story, however, has been viewed with skepticism by some historians, pointing out that the German chronicler Jacob von Staehlin is the only source for the story, and it seems unlikely that no one else would have documented such an act of heroism. This, plus the interval of time between these actions and Peter's death seems to preclude any direct link. In early January 1725, Peter was struck once again with uremia. Legend has it that before lapsing into unconsciousness Peter asked for a paper and pen and scrawled an unfinished note that read: "Leave all to ..." and then, exhausted by the effort, asked for his daughter Anna to be summoned. Peter died between four and five in the morning 8 February 1725.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1700002;Peter was born in Kiel, in the duchy of Holstein-Gottorp. His parents were Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (a nephew of Charles XII of Sweden), and Anna Petrovna (a daughter of Emperor Peter I and Empress Catherine I of Russia). His mother died shortly after his birth. In 1739, Peter's father died, and he became Duke of Holstein-Gottorp as Charles Peter Ulrich at the age of 11.Empress Elizabeth arranged for Peter to marry his 2nd cousin, Sophia Augusta Frederica (later Catherine the Great), daughter of Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst and Princess Joanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp. The young princess formally converted to Russian Orthodoxy and took the name Ekaterina Alexeievna (i.e., Catherine). They married on 21 August 1745. The marriage was not a happy one but produced one son, the future Emperor Paul, and one daughter, Anna Petrovna (20 December 1757 – 19 March 1759). Catherine later claimed that Paul was not fathered by Peter: that, in fact, they had never consummated the marriage. During the sixteen years of their residence in Oranienbaum, Catherine took numerous lovers, while her husband did the same in the beginning. Nature had made him mean, the smallpox had made him hideous, and his degraded habits made him loathsome. And Peter had all the sentiments of the worst kind of small German prince of the time. He had the conviction that his prince status entitled him to disregard decency and the feelings of others. He planned brutal practical jokes, in which blows had always a share. His most manly taste did not rise above the kind of military interest which has been defined as "corporal's mania," the passion for uniforms, pipeclay, buttons, the "tricks of parade and the froth of discipline." He detested the Russians, and surrounded himself with Holsteiners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1700003;Though Catherine's life and reign included remarkable personal successes, they ended in two failures. Her Swedish cousin (once removed), King Gustav IV Adolph, visited her in September 1796, the Empress's intention being that her granddaughter Alexandra should become Queen of Sweden by marriage. A ball was given at the imperial court on 11 September, when the engagement was supposed to be announced. Gustav Adolph felt pressured to accept that Alexandra would not convert to Lutheranism, and though he was delighted by the young lady, he refused to appear at the ball and left for Stockholm. The frustration affected Catherine's health. She recovered well enough to begin to plan a ceremony which would establish her favourite grandson Alexander as her heir, superseding her difficult son Paul, but she died before the announcement could be made, just over two months after the engagement ball. On 16 November 1796, Catherine rose early in the morning and had her usual morning coffee, soon settling down to work on papers; she told her lady's maid, Maria Perekusikhina, that she had slept better than she had in a long time. Sometime after 9:00 she was found on the floor with her face purplish, her pulse weak, and her breathing shallow and laboured. The court physician diagnosed a stroke and despite attempts to revive her she fell into a coma. She was given the last rites and died the following evening around 9:45.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1700004;News have been recently brought to the palace of your majesty about the possibility of a coup being organized by the king's wife, Catherine. They say that for a few weeks now she's been securing trust and legitimacy in various ways. News comes now that she has even managed to secure the backing of the orthodox church. Your Majesty, what shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1700005;In July 1762, barely six months after becoming emperor, Peter lingered with his Holstein-born courtiers and relatives to Oranienbaum, while his wife was at a different palace nearby. On the night of 8 July (OS: 27 June 1762), Catherine the Great was given the news that one of her co-conspirators had been arrested by her estranged husband and that all they had been planning must take place at once. The next day, she left the palace and departed for the Ismailovsky regiment, where she delivered a speech asking the soldiers to protect her from her husband. Catherine then left with the regiment to go to the Semenovsky Barracks, where the clergy was waiting to ordain her as the sole occupant of the Russian throne. She had her husband arrested, and forced to sign a document of abdication, leaving no one to dispute her accession to the throne. On 17 July 1762—eight days after the coup that amazed the outside world and just six months after his accession to the throne—Peter III died at Ropsha, at the hands of Alexei Orlov (younger brother to Grigory Orlov, then a court favourite and a participant in the coup).;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1788000;The leaders of the Anjala conspiracy met in Liikkala to secretly open communications with Tsarina Catherine the Great. Major Johan Anders Jägerhorn delivered the Liikkala note dated August 8, 1788 to the empress. The letter note was signed by several officers, including Armfelt, Commander-in-Chief of the Savo forces and the king's closest confidant. The officers declared the war to be illegal, asked for the restoration of the Finnish borders according to the Treaty of Nystad of 1721, and for peace negotiations with representatives of the Finnish nation, which they understood as representatives for the eastern and northern half of Sweden, which during the 18th century had twice been harshly occupied by Russia, and whose population overwhelmingly were ethnic Finns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1788001;The leaders of the so-called Anjala conspiracy have declared your majesty's rule incompetent and they have seceded our country with the help of Russia. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC172100;The king is dead, whilst the nation reels in grief, a new episode in Swedish history is mounting. The Riksdag of the Estates is gaining massive influence, with its powers restored by order of the new queen, Her Majesty Queen Ulrika. What developments Sweden will experience under this new political atmosphere remains a mystery. If it will usher in an era of untold prosperity in representation of the common people, or if the aristocracy will turn the kingdom into a puppet to line their pockets with, is yet to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1721001;For decades the two factions have torn Sweden apart. The Age of “Liberty” has turned the Kingdom into a sordid melting pot of corruption and covetousness. After great, save futile, attempts from His Majesty Gustav III to dispel the political animosity of the court, he has come to the conclusion that to save Sweden from inevitable Russo-Prussian invasion, he has no other choice than to launch a revolution. On the 19th of august he finally paraded his officers through the palace, soon before declaring the new constitution he addressed them: “If you follow me, just like your ancestors followed Gustav Vasa and Gustavus Adolphus, then I will risk my life and blood for you and the salvation of the fatherland!";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1721002;To dare any possible assassins, the King went out into an open box facing the opera stage. And after roughly ten minutes he said “this would have been an opportunity to shoot. Come, let us go down. The ball seems to be merry and bright.” The King with Baron Hans Henrik von Essen by his right arm went around the theatre once and then into the foyer where they met Captain Carl Fredrik Pollet. The King, von Essen and Pollet continued through a corridor leading from the foyer towards the opera stage where the dancing took place. On the stage several masked men - some witnesses talked of 20 or 30 men - made it impossible for the king to proceed. Due to the crowd, Pollet receded behind the King, who bent backwards to talk to Pollet. Anckarström stood at the entrance to the corridor holding a knife in his left hand and carrying one pistol in his left inner pocket and another pistol in his right back pocket. Anckarström edged himself behind the King, took out the pistol from his left inner pocket and pulled the trigger. Because of the King turning backwards the shot went in at an angle from the third lumbar vertebrae towards the hip region. The King twitched and said “ai” without falling. Anckarström then lost courage, dropped the pistol and knife and shouted fire. People from the King’s lifeguard stood some meters away. When they reached the King, they heard him say “ai, je suis blesse”. (I am wounded.) The king was carried back to his quarters, and the exits of the Opera were sealed. Anckarström was arrested the following morning and immediately confessed to the murder, although he denied a conspiracy until informed that Horn and Ribbing had also been arrested and had confessed in full. The king had not been shot dead; he was alive and continued to function as head of state. The coup was a failure in the short run. However, the wound became infected, and on 29 March, the king finally died with these last words: "I feel sleepy, a few moments' rest would do me good";;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME91241542;Mazepa rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC91241542;As the Swedish and Polish armies advanced towards the Ukraine, Mazepa allied with them on 28 October 1708. However, only 3,000 Cossacks followed their Hetman, with the rest remaining loyal to the Tsar. Mazepa's call to arms was further weakened by the Orthodox Clergy's allegiance to the Tsar;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT91241542OPT1;So he is a traitor? After all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC91241543;Those Cossacks who did not side with Mazepa elected a new Hetman, Ivan Skoropadsky, on 11 November 1708. The fear of further reprisals and suspicion of Mazepa's newfound Swedish ally prevented most of Ukraine's population from siding with him. Surprisingly, the only significant support that he gathered came from the Zaporizhian Sich, which, though at odds with the Hetman in the past, considered him and the nobility he represented a lesser evil compared with the Tsar. The Sich Cossacks paid dearly for their support of Mazepa, as Peter The Great ordered the Sich to be razed in 1709 and a decree was issued to execute any active Zaporizhian Cossack;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC170771;Word comes from Bengal that the traitorous Subahdar Murshid Quli Khan has seceded from the empire and declared himself as the Nawab of Bengal from his capital at Murshidabad. Quli Khan, a Hindu by birth, already had many disagreements with the Alamgir's own grandson over governance of Bengal. Now after Aurangzeb's death the traitor has taken the opportunity to openly declare his act of treason. It appears that he is well supported by local moneylenders and by a strong army. It would thus require a long and costly war to bring him to justice or we could simple accept the grim reality that has haunted the empire since Aurangzeb's death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC170772;In a shocking murder of the virtues of loyalty and nobility, Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung, the governor of Karnatak has seceded from the Mughal empire and declared his own state in the Deccan. Zulfiqar Khan had once been the most dependable of generals in Emperor Aurgangzeb's decades spanning campaign in the Deccan. The emperor had showered him with titles like Amir-ul-Umara(Noble of nobles) and eventually made him the Subahdar. Now after the Alamgir's death he appears to have forgotten all this past and has committed this heinous act of treason. With the unstable situation in the north it would be wise to maintain peace with him or we could go to war to stamp out his rebellion. A campaign to put down his rebellion would be very difficult as we would be fighting his armies in the Deccan, his home ground. The decision must be made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC170773;Taking advantage of the chaos at Delhi after Emperor Aurangzeb's death, the Sikh clans of Punjab have rebelled. The Sikhs have faced religious persecution and political oppression for the last two centuries. A constant guerrilla war has ensued with their Gurus(Religious teachers) in the Punjab and it only intensified after Emperor Aurangzeb's Deccan campaigns as the focus of the empire shifted away from Punjab. Now the Sikhs have captured all major forts and towns in the area and declared an independent Sikh state. This threatens to cut off contact between our possessions in Afghanistan with the rest of the empire. We could negotiate with the Sikhs or march our mighty armies to crush their insurrection. Both methods would require immediate action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC170774;The flag of rebellion has been raised in Ayodhya as the Subahdar of Ouduh has seceded from the Mughal empire. Ouduh had been one of the richest provinces of the empire since its earliest days. Now the rebellious ruler has kicked out the local Mughal garrison, brought the support of various treasonous chiefs and crowned himself as it's ruler. Additionally, important roads leading from Delhi to Bengal are now in danger of being closed off which could bring trade to a complete standstill. Quick steps should be taken whether we decide to ignore his rebellion in favour of more important theatres or march upon his lands to restore the authority of the Mughal throne on Ouduh once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC170776;Grim news comes from Sindh. The Kalhoras have disregarded Mughal authority and declared independence. Sindh is an important center of maritime trade on the Arabian sea and Muslim pilgrims to Haj are an important source of commerce in the region. Kalhora rule of Sindh began in 1701 when Mian Yar Muhammad Kalhoro was invested with title of Khuda Yar Khan and was made governor of Upper Sindh sarkar by royal decree of the Mughals. Later, he was made governor of Siwi through imperial decree. Thenceforth, Mian Yar Muhammad became the imperial governor of the entire Sindh. Now however with the weakening of Mughal authority after the death of Emperor Aurangzeb, the Kalhoras have become confident enough to declare open rebellion. We must make moves to crush their confidence by facing them in battle on the lands of West India and crush their rebellion. Alternatively we may just let go of the Subah and concentrate on other theatres. The choice must be made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC170775;If there is a contender for the second most powerful man in India at this moment, then it's undoubtedly the Nizam of Hyderabad. Unfortunately it appears that this strongman of the Deccan has gotten tired of bowing before Imperial authority. The Nizam of Hyderabad has declared his independence and now claims his rule over most of the Deccan. Our choices are simple. We could match our armies South, fight a tedious war and attempt to crush his rebellion or we could instead avoid bloodshed and come to terms with him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC170778;The recent spate of wars and civil wars have utterly destroyed the power of the Mughal empire in Hindustan. The green banner of the Mughals, once flying high all over the subcontinent now flutters lifelessly in Delhi and a few remaining areas around it. The empire is now a snakehole of court politics and dirty plots supported by foreign kings. It's gone. But out of the ashes of one empire, a second shall rise! Perhaps it's now our age of glory and by Shiva's grace, we Marathas shall claim it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC170777;The flowers have blossomed and the sun shines golden upon Hindavi Swarajya as Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj has returned from his imprisonment in Delhi to lead an independent Maratha nation. After Maharaj Sambhaji's capture and execution by the Mughals, his son Shahu had been imprisoned along with his mother at Delhi by Emperor Aurangzeb. Meanwhile Shahu's uncle and then his cousin had declared themselves as the ruler at Kolhapur while the Mughals swiftly defeated the Marathas and forced them to negotiate. His aunt Tarabai in particular had gone so far as to make peace with the Mughals to ensure the rule of her son Shivaji II. Now with Aurangzeb's death, influential Mughal courtiers have released Chhatrapati Shahu in hopes that he would be a useful ally. Having defeated Tarabai, the Chhatrapati now leads a powerful force of Marathas. With the Mughal collapse, the gates of India are now open for us. Perhaps the rich neighbouring state of Gujurath might be an opportunity for quick conquest if we are ready to face the Mughals as our men have done countless times before that is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC170779;It's our own incompetence and poor luck that has destroyed our once great Mughal empire after the Alamgir's death. Perhaps our warriors didn't fight hard, perhaps out men were not loyal or perhaps Allah is testing us. Whatever may be the reason, it's clear that while we remain the 'Mughal Empire', we are no longer a real empire. Our authority once extending across the entire subcontinent is now only effective in Delhi and the surrounding areas. All over Hindustan, new princes and states have risen and are calling our empire as their own, perhaps rightly so. Even the great Babur had lost Samarkhand and managed to keep his resolve to fight and create the Mughal Empire. Perhaps we may rise again just as he did, but for now we have clearly lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC175001;Oh the Mughal Sooltans were great and big all right, but their era is gone Sir. With their collapse,  India is now open for the Company. Years of investments in schemes and factories on the coast of India have paid off. We have patiently adhered to the rules and regulations of Delhi, we have borne their insults and their conditions and we have tipped our hats in their presence....for a century. No more. Its time we use this opportunity to annex the exclaves of the Mughals. They won't mind of course......because they can't! The East India Company shall now be a force in its own right and soon, the sun shall never set upon the Union Jack. Hail Brittania!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1573000;With the recent passing of Augustus II of Saxony, the time has come to honor our country's tradition and gather all the nobility for the election of a new ruler which will lead us to greatness. There have been a few concerns about the involvement of our eastern neighbours in the election, but hopefully it's only rumours. There are 3 main candidates for the Polish-Lithuanian throne: \n- Stanislaw Leszczynski - the current duke of Lorraine and strongly supported by France \n- Friedrich August III of Saxony the son of our previous ruler, who is rumoured to have been getting support from Russia \n- Infante Manuel, the Count of Ourem relatively unknown in our country and among the nobility, however he has a strong support from Austria.\n-The candidates are all fair choices, let's see who receives the most votes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1573001;The recent Election in Poland-Lithuania resulted in the loss of our Candidate! This is an unwelcome surprise, the Russians said our victory will be secured, and the saxon dynasty will continue to rule the lands along the Vistula river! Our only choice is to inform the Russians of this outrageous incident and have them help us secure our rightful throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1573002;A saxon envoy arrived today at our court, telling of the results of Polish-Lithuanian Royal Election, which had our preferred candidate lose! This may effectively destroy all the influence we had in the Polish court, which is unacceptable! We are ought to intervene immediately if we want Poland-Lithuania to never be a threat to Russia ever again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1573004;Sad new have arrived today, as our current ruler has passed away. As tragic as it may be we must keep moving forward and the time has come to once again honor the almost 200-year old tradition of royal election. There have been 3 candidates that emerged as leading figures to secure our throne; \n- Stanislaw August Poniatowski - Supported by Russia, a member of the Czartoryski Family and an intellectual. He is also rumored to had been having an affair with The Russian Tsar - Catharine Romanov. He may be in favor of continuing the Russian schemes in our court. \n- Jan Klemens Branicki is in charge of our southern Ruthenian provinces, he is known to be a conservative and isn't really widely known among the higher Polish nobility. \n- Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski, the brother of Stansilaw, the first candidate. A proper member of the Familia party, which has been proposing many liberal reforms for the past years, which all were unfortunately vetoed by our conservative nobility. \n- it is critical we elect a worth candidate, as our very existence as a sovereign nation is at risk in this dark times;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC15730041;Recognizing that the destiny of us all depends solely upon the establishment and perfection of a national constitution, having by long experience learned the inveterate faults of our government, and desiring to take advantage of the season in which Europe finds itself and of this dying moment that has restored us to ourselves, free of the ignominious dictates of foreign coercion, holding dearer than life, than personal happiness the political existence, external independence and internal liberty of the people whose destiny is entrusted to our hands, and desiring to merit the blessing and gratitude of contemporary and future generations, despite obstacles that may cause passions in us, we do for the general welfare, for the establishment of liberty, for the preservation of our country and its borders, with the utmost constancy of spirit ordain this Constitution and declare it to be entirely sacred and inviolable until the people, at the time by law prescribed, by their clear will recognize a need to alter any of its articles. To which Constitution the further statutes of the present Sejm shall apply in everything. Or will it? should we ratify this document my King or is it too dangerous?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC15730042;Not all nobles agree with our newly ratified constitution. A confederation was established by Polish and Lithuanian magnates, in Saint Petersburg, with the backing of the Russian Empress Catherine II. The confederation opposes our new government, which had been adopted by the Great Sejm, especially the provisions limiting the privileges of the nobility. The text of the founding act of the confederation was drafted by the Russian general Vasili Stepanovich Popov, Chief of Staff of Prince Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin. Its purpose was proclaimed in the small town of Targowica and the Potocki's estate (now near Novoarkhanhelsk in Kirovohrad Oblast, Ukraine).This may result in a full scale Russian intervention...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC171107;Louis XIV, known as Louis the Great (Louis le Grand) or the Sun King (le Roi Soleil), was King of France from 14 May 1643 until his death in 1715. His reign of 72 years and 110 days is the longest recorded of any monarch of a sovereign country in European history. In the age of absolutism in Europe, Louis XIV's France was a leader in the growing centralization of power. Louis began his personal rule of France in 1661, after the death of his chief minister, the Italian Cardinal Mazarin. An adherent of the concept of the divine right of kings, Louis continued his predecessors' work of creating a centralised state governed from the capital. He sought to eliminate the remnants of feudalism persisting in parts of France and, by compelling many members of the nobility to inhabit his lavish Palace of Versailles, succeeded in pacifying the aristocracy, many members of which had participated in the Fronde rebellion during Louis' minority. By these means he became one of the most powerful French monarchs and consolidated a system of absolute monarchical rule in France that endured until the French Revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC171108;From 1647 to 1711, the three chief physicians to the king (Antoine Vallot, Antoine d'Aquin, and Guy-Crescent Fagon) recorded all of his health problems in the Journal de Sante du Roi (Journal of the King's Health), a daily report of his health. On 18 November 1686, Louis underwent a painful operation for an anal fistula that was performed by the surgeon Charles Felix de Tassy, who prepared a specially shaped curved scalpel for the occasion. The wound took more than two months to heal. Louis died of gangrene at Versailles on 1 September 1715, four days before his 77th birthday, after 72 years on the throne. Enduring much pain in his last days, he finally "yielded up his soul without any effort, like a candle going out", while reciting the psalm Domine, ad adjuvandum me festina (O Lord, make haste to help me).;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC171109;The past few years have not been kind to our poorest citizens and peasantry. The combination of our high taxes and the overall dissatisfaction with the regime among the populace has resulted in the general growing unrest among our people. If we don't do something about it, our plans for european expansion may be halted. This issue truly requires a drastic change in our ways of governing, but we know that only absolute power can guarantee the safety of our subjects!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC171110;The King of France has announced his claims to the Northern Italian lands! This is outrageous! What's even worse we cannot stand alone against the French. An idea has been spreading around the members of our court to establish a confederacy between the Italian states free of the Bourbon influence. The other option of course is to ask the emperor for help, but our nobles see it as more of a "last resort".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC171111;Tuscan diplomat has came to us with a proposition for a defensive confederacy against the french imperialists. This confederacy would in theory respect our freedoms and give us autonomy for the time of war with France as well as aim to diminish all French influence in the region. The proposition is indeed tempting, but many of our ministers fear the Tuscan domination in this Confederacy, what should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC174500;Charles VI died on 20 October 1740, probably out of mushroom poisoning. He had ignored the advice of Prince Eugene of Savoy who had urged him to concentrate on filling the treasury and equipping the army rather than on acquiring signatures of fellow monarchs. The Emperor, who spent his entire reign securing the Pragmatic Sanction, left Austria in an impoverished state, bankrupted by the recent Turkish war and the War of the Polish Succession; the treasury contained only 100,000 gulden, which were claimed by his widow. The army had also been weakened due to these wars; instead of the full number of 160,000, the army had been reduced to about 108,000, and they were scattered in small areas from the Austrian Netherlands to Transylvania, and from Silesia to Tuscany. They were also poorly trained and discipline was lacking. Later Maria Theresa even made a remark: "as for the state in which I found the army, I cannot begin to describe it." But this will all soon come to an end. As Maria Theresa Begins her reign, a new era approaches Austria, one of greatness and prosperity!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC174501;It is unlikely that Maria Theresa ever completely recovered from the smallpox attack in 1767, as 18th-century writers asserted. She suffered from shortness of breath, fatigue, cough, distress, necrophobia and insomnia. She later developed edema. Maria Theresa fell ill on 24 November 1780. Her physician Dr. Störk thought her condition serious, although Joseph was confident that she would recover in no time. By 26 November, she asked for the last rites, and on 28 November, the doctor told her that the time had come. On 29 November, she died surrounded by her remaining children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC6082;In 1647 Tibet had a political revolution which gave the Dalai Lama absolute power and diminished Dzungar influence in the country.

EVTDESC1721003;As another king drops dead from his throne, the coronation ceremonies are already in full swing. Today we celebrate the ascension of His Imperial Majesty King Gustav, third of his name, dynast of Holstein-Gottorp, first cousin of Catherine the Great, nephew of Fredrick the Great. Truly a man with legitimacy in place of blood in his veins, as is required if one is to rule an empire stretching from Göteborg to Livonia to the top of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC174502;Since the death of Charles II of Spain, the Habsburg family and its realms developed a serious problem. Their male lines began to go extinct. First Charles II died without a heir and that resulted in the war of Spanish succession. In 1703 Charles VI, the prince of Austria signed a mutual pact with his elder brother Joseph I. One of its agreements was that in case they both failed to have a male heir, then Joseph's daughters would inherit all Habsburg pessesions after both of them had died. Joseph became Holy Roman emperor soon after, failed to have a male heir and died in 1711 after which Charles VI succeeded him. However Charles himself failed to produce a male heir and began to worry that upon his death, the Habsburg domains would slip away from his line to Joseph's daughters as decreed by the Mutual pact of 1703. To counter that, Charles has now declared a Pragmatic sanction law according to which his daughters would inherit the throne rather than his nieces. This has not been received well by many in the empire and abroad and may just prove to be the spark of future internal strife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC176800;Prince Kristian had always been a strange child, he had no blemish in his brilliant intellect nor his dazzling charisma, but his oddity lay deeper. He was beset by hallucinations, devastating personality swings, melancholy, and an emerging destruction mania. Unfortunately his redeeming qualities could never be fully realized, as his education was largely ignored, and the tutor that he did have was outright abusive. Many speculate that his mental state was inherited through blood, as his Cousin, George III of Great Britain, showed similar traits, known widely as the “Royal Malady”. Upon the death of Fredrik V, Kristian ascended to the throne, his chosen motto was: “Gloria ex amore patriae”, meaning, “glory through love of the fatherland”.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC171009;It probably started in some backalley in Paris, then it spread to the neighbouring lanes and streets. Further it creeped its way to the surrounding countryside. Now the flame of revolution has spread to the whole of France and threatens to overturn our rule of the Dual monarchy. Years of English rule have been declared as an oppression and French people from every echelon of society have taken up arms against the Dual Monarchy. From lowly peasants to conspiring armymen, many have joined the rebel army and a deadly war to shake the very foundations of our rule in France has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC171000;War after war has launched Britain’s debt into orbit. The debt is, in fact, so staggeringly large that nobody actually knows exactly how much we owe. Britain’s balance sheet shows a hastily written rough estimate of “9,000,000 Pounds” (This would only be fully repaid recently, in 2015, three centuries later). Bankruptcy now could very well mean our utter collapse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC171001;Facing up to 20 million pounds of debt, our ministry has been forced to take some desperate measures to keep our nation from outright collapsing. The chancellor of the exchequer (minister of debt) has joined together with a rather.. conniving.. Businessman. Together they have founded The South Sea Company to deal with government debt, a government puppeted trading company with monopoly in Latin America. However, these ports are all owned by Spain, and the recent Spanish war of succession has made British trading here nigh impossible. Instead, to make money, the company has launched a less than honourable scheme, involving all kinds of scamming, corruption, and general skullduggery. The company, without earning a single pound in actual profit, is beginning to make ever accelerating swathes of dishonest money. Money, however, that the government sorely needs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC15730044;Leszczynski's faction has proposed the plan for a reform of the Commonwealth. It involves some radical changes like peasant emancipation, urbanisation, and army reform, as well as stricter organization of political institutions, resulting in stronger central government. Despite that noble privileges are to stay in place, making every "citizen" truly equal to the demise of the most powerful of nobles, and the question lies, indeed, in whether we are willing to challenge omnipotent magnates, and lesser ones loyal to them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC15730043;Folwark system is based on large scale farming and unpaid labour of serfs, arguably a form of slavery. Initially it yielded great profits for economy of the Commonwealth, however it become apparent that in the long run the system was dragging country down, seeing how urbanisation in western Europe, that imported the grain, flourished, while Poland-Lithuania stagnated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1740001;Crown Prince Frederick von Hohenzollern was born to Friedrich-Wilhelm I in Berlin, 1712. Tutored by the same French governess as his father, he was in every aspect pushed to be just like the king. Friedrich-Wilhelm was a man of great renown, popularly known as the “soldier-king”, he had expanded the army by spectacular degrees for his small population, and was generally a very effective ruler. This put massive pressure on Prince Fredrick, who was more interested in art and literature, this would drive his militaristic father to rage, and concluded in beatings and public humiliation. Now he kneels at the foot of the coronation ceremony, standing to inherit an army of 80 thousand of the most disciplined soldiers in Europe. The state of which having observed decades of incline to prosperity, surely Fredrick II can’t possibly muster himself a name so great to rival his father’s?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC176801;King Kristian’s reign was never let go uneventful, it was marked by constant changes in attitude and replacement to the council of advisors depending on his mood. His court life was hectic if not dangerous, he was reported to have been obsessed with destruction, smashing furniture and windows, committing severe self harm, and even beating his own dogs bloody. He was unanimously considered mad by a certain point, for which reason his personal physiatrist, Struensee, gained immense power within the government. In fact, the outright torture Struensee inflicted on Kristian could be the source of his spiralling mental health. His advisors were particularly concerned with the less.. Christian.. Of his hobbies. On the 14th of January 1808 his carrot-waxing was cut short by a stroke, although rumors state that he died due to the shock of observing Spanish auxiliary troops, which he took to be hostile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1740002;Granted, his father had set the kindling, but Frederick II had lit it, the bonfire that is Prussia. Victorious in all the great European wars of his time, he was no mere successor to his father, he had forged a legacy of his own. His military prowess alone, both in theory and practice, has earned him a place among the great of history. But grander still, he had been a patron of art, science, music and culture, truly a bastion of the enlightenment. Infact, upon his accession, he was told by the French philosopher D’Alembert, “The philosophers and the men of letters in every land have looked upon you, Sire, as their leader and model.” The Silesian Wars, The War of Austrian Succession, the Partition of Poland, surely not even death will stop our great Frederick.

EVTDESC1740005;In his younger years Frederick was sent to a small village in Prussia by his father as a punishment for attempting to flee the country. In that time young Frederick learned the hardships of regular peasants.

EVTDESC176802;Since the King clearly cannot handle the task layed before him as the ruler of Denmark-Norway we need to appoint a court physician and a perfect candidate has recently distinguished himself. The so called Johann Friedrich Struensee During Struensee's near ten-year residence in Altona he came into contact with a circle of aristocrats who had been sent away from the royal court in Copenhagen. Among them were Enevold Brandt and Count Schack Carl Rantzau, who were supporters of the Enlightenment. Rantzau recommended Struensee to the court as a physician to attend King Christian VII on his forthcoming tour to princely and royal courts in western Germany, the Netherlands, England, and France. Struensee received the appointment in April 1768. Should we Employ me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC176803;Struensee's dismissal of many government officials and officers brought him many political enemies. On 30 November 1771, he declared himself and Brandt Counts.

EVTDESC16970;After years of useless bickering and disputes, the matter of the Sino-Korean border is to be decided from the highest pedestals of authority in both nations. The Kangxi Emperor and the Joseon of Korea have both sent their diplomats and agreed to bring an end to this border conflict once and for all. The Qing delegation is led by Mukedeng, and the Joseon delegation is led by Pak Kwon. Befre the meet, the two have held a joint commission to survey and demarcate the boundaries between the two states. After extensive geographic surveys and travels up and down the rivers Yalu and Tyumen, the delegates have finally assembled the information and the meeting has begun. The Koreans claim that the territories held by the 7th century Gorguryeo dynasty north of the river are true and that those boundaries should be restored. However giving in to their demands would be seen as a sign of weakness which might harm us in future diplomacy. Our own claims extend a little south of the river in accordance with the territories claimed by the Jurchen Jaegaseung monks as their homeland. But trying to enforce these claims might antagonize the Koreans and may lead to needless violence. Instead, diplomats from both sides also propose a simple third solution. To mark the boundary on the river instead. A simple river dividing two great dynastic empires!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC174504;The success of the Dutch, British and French East India Companies led the merchants and shipowners of Ostend in the Austrian Netherlands to want to establish direct commercial relations with the Indies. The trade from Ostend to Mocha, India, Bengal and China started in 1715. Some private merchants from Antwerp, Ghent and Ostend were granted charters for the East India trade by the Habsburg government of the Austrian Netherlands, which had recently gained control of the territory from Spain. Between 1715 and 1723, 34 ships sailed from Ostend to China, the Malabar or Coromandel Coasts, Surat, Bengal or Mocha. Those expeditions were financed by different international syndicates composed of Flemish, English, Dutch and French merchants and bankers.Between 1724 and 1732, 21 company vessels were sent out, mainly to Canton in China and to Bengal. Thanks to the rise in tea prices, high profits were made in the China trade. Between 1719 and 1728, the Ostend Company transported 7 million pounds of tea from China (roughly half of the total amount brought to western Europe), which would be about the same as British East India Company during the same period.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC171002;The South Sea Company was by no means the only company seeking to raise money from investors in 1720. A large number of other joint-stock companies had been created making extravagant (sometimes fraudulent) claims about foreign or other ventures or bizarre schemes. Others represented potentially sound, although novel, schemes, such as for founding insurance companies. These were nicknamed "Bubbles". Some of the companies had no legal basis, while others, such as the Hollow Sword Blade company acting as the South Sea's banker, used existing chartered companies for purposes entirely different from their creation. The York Buildings Company was set up to provide water to London, but was purchased by Case Billingsley who used it to purchase confiscated Jacobite estates in Scotland, which then formed the assets of an insurance company. The passing of the Act gave a boost to the South Sea Company, its shares leaping to £890 in early June. This peak encouraged people to start to sell; to counterbalance this the company's directors ordered their agents to buy, which succeeded in propping the price up at around £750.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC171003;By the end of September the stock had fallen to £150. Company failures now extended to banks and goldsmiths, as they could not collect loans made on the stock, and thousands of individuals were ruined, including many members of the aristocracy. With investors outraged, Parliament was recalled in December and an investigation began. Reporting in 1721, it revealed widespread fraud amongst the company directors and corruption in the Cabinet. Among those implicated were John Aislabie (the Chancellor of the Exchequer), James Craggs the Elder (the Postmaster General), James Craggs the Younger (the Southern Secretary), and even Lord Stanhope and Lord Sunderland (the heads of the Ministry). Craggs the Elder and Craggs the Younger both died in disgrace; the remainder were impeached for their corruption. The Commons found Aislabie guilty of the "most notorious, dangerous and infamous corruption", and he was imprisoned.;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC171005;The newly appointed First Lord of the Treasury, Robert Walpole, successfully restored public confidence in the financial system. However, public opinion, as shaped by the many prominent men who lost money, demanded revenge. Walpole supervised the process, which removed all 33 of the company directors and stripped them of, on average, 82% of their wealth. The money went to the victims and the stock of the South Sea Company was divided between the Bank of England and the East India Company. Walpole made sure that King George and his mistresses were protected, and by a margin of three votes he managed to save several key government officials from impeachment. In the process, Walpole won plaudits as the savior of the financial system while establishing himself as the dominant figure in British politics; historians credit him for rescuing the Whig government, and indeed the Hanoverian Dynasty, from total disgrace.;;;;;;;;;;;;

They demand wind at our back, and to them we answer: Our sails will billow! Now just to choose a path at our crossroads, for ambition is nothing without direction. We can choose to either expand further into Northern Italy, and claim the cradle of the renaissance. Or to dominate the mediterranean, and become an archipelago of our own. (This choice is important, as it will decide your path for the rest of the game);;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC712341;At 10:00 this morning a Venetian ambassador arrived at our capital, issuing us a document demanding complete cessation of the crown of Lombardio-Venetien within the week, they are to assume serene overlordship over the Duchy, and threaten us with military action if we are to refuse.

EVTDESC712344;After annexation of the island, all Genoese bureaucrats were forced to flee, leaving a power vacuum.

Corsica is only yet ours nominally, as we have lost any control we may have gained in the peace treaty with Genoa.;;;;;;;;;;;;

This was no doubt staged by the Genoese, as means to justify war.

But this could also very well be another chance to exercise our famed opportunism…;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC712346;At 11:00 this morning a Venetian ambassador arrived in Istanbul, issuing us a document demanding complete forfeit of Gallipoli, Morea, Atina, Khalkis, Iraklion, Cyprus, southern Crimea and more. This is an outrageous request, we would be surrendering massive swathes of the Greek land that we have fought and died for. Surely we haven’t declined to the point where we are willing to hand out bloodbound Turkish ground to some covetous snakes. But.. they have gotten quite powerful as of late. The undying quarrel amongst the advisory proves this to be one of the greatest crises in Ottoman history, what are we to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC69691;Where pirates once dominated seas stretching from The Caribbean to Persia, are now all but rid of their buccaneering terrorizers. Pirate after pirate hath met their end, be it by sword or pardon, the deaths of greats such as Blackbeard and Black Bart have alerted the world to the fact that Atlantic piracy can no longer thrive as it once did. The great powers of Europe having been at peace for so long has heightened government control over the seas and the use of privateers has declined due to Europe's shift toward free trade. These two factors combined have rendered piracy an unsustainable trade. The merchant can now sleep soundly at night knowing that the Atlantic's air is no longer filled with the fluttering of the jolly roger, nor its waters the sound of the dreadful hull.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC175005;Under Mughal rule, Bengal was an affluent province with a major stake in local and foreign trade. It is estimated that during the 16th and 17th centuries, Bengal supplied most of the opium, silk, textiles and saltpetre to local and European markets. In fact, Bengal was so dominant in the trade of Muslim that to this day Muslin is called 'Daka' in central Asia which comes from the Bengali city name of 'Dhaka'! Now all that is gone. With the weakning of the Mughal empire and the resulting civil strife, Bengali trade was shook to its core. Then the incompetent Nawabs and greedy Europeans steadily dismantled Bengal's economy such that now the Europeans control the ports and the trade while Bengal remains as a submissive supplier for Europe's factories. Recently, with an even further decline in the economy and an over-reliance on the Europeans, Bengal has lost the last vestiges of its economic independence effectively making it nothing but a puppet state of the British.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9300010;Grim news arrives from Aragon as popular resentment against heavy taxation combined with the damaging toll of the succession war has resulted in open rebellion against the crown. Despite uniting with Castille to form Spain, Aragon never gave up it's unique culture and administrative practices. Instead, attempts to integrate the region into a Castilian system of governance only resulted in failure and made Aragonese cultural movements stronger. Famine, disease and almost continuous warfare in the Spanish Netherlands drained money, energy and men and weakened the economy so much that it is estimated the population of Spain fell nearly 25% between 1600 and 1700. All this had a damaging effect on Aragon too. Now the economic stress of the succession war and the resulting steep increase in taxation have put the final nail in the coffin and the Aragonese nobility and peasantry alike have taken up arms against the King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1721005;In the last one and a half century, Sweden has rapidly risen to great power status. With a small yet professional army, the Swedes have built an empire with holdings on both sides of the Baltic by defeated its rivals in Moscow, Poland and Denmark along with numerous other German states.  Since the middle of the previous century, the King Charles XI had ruled Sweden. After the end of the devastating Scanian war in 1679, Charles XI devoted the rest of his life to avoiding further warfare by gaining larger independence in foreign affairs while he also promoted economic stabilization and a reorganization of the military. His remaining 20 years on the throne were thus the longest peacetime that Sweden experienced in recent history. With Charles's death in 1697, the throne passed to his 14 year old son Charles XII. For a few years Sweden experienced an uneasy peace. Now, the treacherous Russians and their allies have decided to take advantage of Charles XII's inexperience and have declared an Anti-Sweden coalition. War has come to Sweden. This war shall decide the fate of Charles XII, the fate of Northern Europe and the fate of Sweden itself.  This war is termed by many as being 'The Great Northern War'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They managed to return 2,000 peasants and deserters, another no less part hid in the steppes and ravines, and ultimately joined the detachment of the Bakhmut centurion K. Bulavin. The detachment of K. Bulavin attacked and destroyed the head detachment of V. Dolgorukov, who stood at night in the Shulginsky town (on Aydar).

EVTDESC18999;Napoleon Bonaparte has been rising through the ranks of our military for quite some time, gaining fame and admiration from many French people. Perhaps we should promote hime to a more important rank, so he can truly show how good military leader he actually is?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC114300;In the early 1700s, Portugal and the english estabilished a commercial and military treaty which some historians claim placed the former as an economic dependency of the latter. From then on the portuguese enjoyed british military support in a number of conflicts, both in Europe and the Americas, thereby serving to maintain unity of their colonial possessions. In return, trade in english textiles and portuguese wine were encouraged by both sides.?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC114301;The discovery of gold, diamonds and precious stones in the interior of Brazil came with a sudden boom of both the Slave Trade towards the southeast of the colony as well as a large emigration from the kingdom proper towards the colonies. The Crown would try to control this flux, but it was inevitable that lure would be too powerful for the poorer regions in the north to resist.?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC114302;Dom John V, known as the Magnanimous and the Portuguese Sun King, was a monarch of the House of Braganza who ruled as King of Portugal during the first half of the 18th century. John V's reign saw the rise of Portugal and its monarchy to new levels of prosperity, wealth, and prestige among European courts. Disregarding traditional Portuguese institutions of governance, John V ruled as an absolute monarch. As a continuation of a Braganza dynasty policy that stressed the importance of relations with Europe, John's reign was marked by numerous interventions into the affairs of other European states, most notably as part of the War of the Spanish Succession. On the imperial front, John V pursued an expansionist policy, with significant territorial gains in Portuguese India and Portuguese America.?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC114303;John was afflicted with dropsy which caused his death in 1750 at age 60. John is often remembered as one of the greatest patrons of the arts in Portuguese history, having commissioned numerous construction projects and artistic studies. The king's most famous and important work was the Royal Palace-Convent of Mafra.?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC114304;Sebastião Jose de Carvalho e Melo, the eventual Marquis of Pombal and Count of Oeira, rose to proeminence as the prime minister of King José I and defacto ruler of Portugal for over twenty years. A controversial figure, sometimes called Portugal's enlightened absolutist, he presided a number of reforms of public administration, education and the very social order of the Kingdom in an effort which, most modern historians agree, were an attempt to concentrate power in the Crown and to revitalize the traditional structures of Portugal.?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC114305;The first reigning Queen of Portugal would ascend to the throne and immediately seek a policy of reconciliation with those who suffered most the policies of her predecessor. In a process termed 'The Turnabout', the Marquis of Pombal was removed from office, the survivors of the Távora family were pardoned and some of the anti-jesuit policies were rolled back. During her reign, new trade opportunities would be opened with Russia and the portuguese commercial imbalance would be temporarily resolved. However, the Queen suffered from acute melancholy and mental ilness, which eventually rendered her unable to serve during the latter part of her life.?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC114306;The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, also known as the Great Lisbon earthquake, occurred in Portugal on the morning of Saturday, 1 November, Feast of All Saints, at around 09:40 local time.In combination with subsequent fires and a tsunami, the earthquake almost totally destroyed Lisbon and adjoining areas. Seismologists today estimate the Lisbon earthquake had a magnitude of 8.4 on the moment magnitude scale, with its epicenter in the Atlantic Ocean about 200 km (120 mi) west-southwest of Cape St. Vincent. Chronologically it was the third known large scale earthquake to hit the city (one in 1321 and another in 1531). Estimates place the death toll in Lisbon alone between 10,000 and 30,000 people, making it one of the deadliest earthquakes in history.?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC114307;Our capital is being rebuild. The Portugese people from around the country have came to lend their hand in making Lisbon return to at least the fraction of it's past glory.?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC114308;In an effort to revitalize farming and commerce in northern Brazil, Portugal would be inspired by the french and dutch models in creating monopolist companies with the mandate of maintaining trade routes and expanding the sale of slaves.?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC114309;For centuries, the Company of Jesus had been central to the colonization of Brazil in its role of building native settlements and spreading christianity among the tribes.They also became a major pillar of support in Portugal itself, as the ruling house of Braganza faced terrible opposition from a Spain-aligned Papacy since the Restoration War. As such the Order had become the single greatest landowning group across the colonies. Opposition to Jesuit power came in many ways, from landlords who wished to enslave their native charges to, eventually, the economic interests of the State. ?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC158100;The modern Netherlands Navy dates its founding to a "statute of admiralty" issued by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I on 8 January 1488. Naval historians trace the origins of an independent Dutch navy to the early stages of the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648) while the formation of a "national" navy is dated to the establishment of the Dutch Republic in 1597. As an organization, the navy of the Dutch Republic consisted of five separate admiralties (three of them in Holland, and one each in Friesland and Zeeland), each with its own ships, personnel, shipyards, command structures and revenues. It remained as one of the more effective naval institutions in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC158101;As War is again upon us, and the enemy is closing in on our capital, perhaps it is time to reestablish the stadtholdress dominating position in our republic. It would allow us to more easly push reforms more easly and gain a greater controll over our government's policys.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC158103;The unrest in our nation caused by our latest wars and our subsequant achieved by our stadtholder have made our people more open to the idea of a monarch. Now people are ralling in support of our stadtholder, calling for him to take the crown of a new kingdom of the Netherlands. Thanks to the orangist's faction dominance in our politics this might be possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC158102;The Patriot movement took in a wide range of supporters: discontented noblemen such as the Gelderland baron Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol wealthy bankers and businessmen without a voice in government; artisans and shopkeepers, traditionally Orangist in sympathy, who were dismayed to find their claims to an effective role in the politics of their towns rebuffed by the princes; and intellectuals committed to the new Enlightenment rejection of arbitrary power. The Patriots included in their ranks many Protestant dissenters and Roman Catholics, but Jews continued to look to the prince of Orange as their protector.;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC158105;The Brabant Revolution was the product of opposition which emerged to the liberal reforms of Emperor Joseph II in the 1780s. These were perceived as an attack on the Catholic Church and the traditional institutions in the Austrian Netherlands. Resistance, focused in the autonomous and wealthy Estates of Brabant and Flanders, grew. In the aftermath of rioting and disruption in 1787, known as the Small Revolution, many dissidents took refuge in the neighboring Dutch Republic where they formed a rebel army. Soon after the outbreak of the French and Liege revolutions, this emigre army crossed into the Austrian Netherlands and decisively defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Turnhout in October 1789. The rebels, supported by uprisings across the territory, soon took control over virtually all the Southern Netherlands and proclaimed independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1821000;The central American people, unhappy with our rule have seceden from out nation! From the 16th century through 1821, Central America, apart from Panama, formed the Captaincy General of Guatemala within the Spanish Empire. In 1821 a congress of Central American Criollos in Guatemala City composed the Act of Independence of Central America to declare the region's independence from Spain, effective on September 15 of that year. The process was bloodless with no resistance from the Spanish authorities as the Governor General Brigadier Gabino Gaínza, along with all the royal governors of the five provinces, were retained in office as executive powers pending a full transition to local rule. That date is still marked as independence day by most Central American nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1821001;Congress plans to establish a constitutional monarchy united both conservatives and liberals at a time when it was uncertain which form of government would be best for independent Mexico. Congress published an oath binding the emperor to obey the constitution, which Iturbide subsequently took, and Congress also declared the Mexican monarchy to be hereditary, granting titles of nobility to Iturbide's family. His son and heir became Prince Imperial of Mexico. The 19th of May was made a national holiday, and a royal household was organized. July 21, 1822 was set as the date of the official coronation.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1821002;As a newly formed and independent nation we should seek living space to expand into.

EVTDESC170007;Between the years of 1560 and 1658, Sweden created a Baltic empire centred on the Gulf of Finland and comprising the provinces of Karelia, Ingria, Estonia, and Livonia. During the Thirty Years' War Sweden gained tracts in Germany as well, including Western Pomerania, Wismar, the Duchy of Bremen, and Verden. During the same period, Sweden conquered Danish and Norwegian provinces north of the Sound. These victories may be ascribed to a well-trained army, which despite its comparatively small size, was far more professional than most continental armies, and also to a modernization of administration (both civilian and military) in the course of the 17th century, which enabled the monarchy to harness the resources of the country and its empire in an effective way. In the late 1690s, the adventurer Johann Patkul managed to ally Russia with Denmark and Saxony by the secret Treaty of Preobrazhenskoye, and in 1700 the three powers attacked.;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1740009;In return for an alliance against France in the War of the Spanish Succession, the Great Elector's son, Frederick III, was allowed to elevate Prussia to a kingdom in the Crown Treaty of 16 November 1700. Frederick crowned himself "King in Prussia" as Frederick I on 18 January 1701. Legally, no kingdoms could exist in the Holy Roman Empire except for Bohemia. However, Frederick took the line that since Prussia had never been part of the empire and the Hohenzollerns were fully sovereign over it, he could elevate Prussia to a kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC157303;The Treaty of the Three Black Eagles, or Treaty of Berlin, was a secret treaty signed in September and December 1732 between the Austrian Empire, the Russian Empire and Prussia. It concerned the joint policy of the three powers regarding to the succession of the Polish throne in light of the expected death of King Augustus II of Poland (and Elector of Saxony from the House of Wettin) and the Polish custom of royal elections. It intended to exclude the candidacies of Augustus' son, Frederick Augustus, and of Stanislas Leszczynski, who had already been king of Poland from 1704 to 1709. The Treaty of the Three Black Eagles had several goals. The agreement had provisions for all three powers to agree that it was in their best interest that their common neighbour, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, did not undertake any reforms that might strengthen it and for its elected monarch to be friendly towards them.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC170025;Upon the capture of the fortress Kantsy, the Council of War had gathered to decide whether to further strengthen that redoubt or to look for another, more convenient place for the fortress (because the above-mentioned Kantsy was too small, too far from the sea and not conveniently protected by its natural surroundings). The Council resolved to look for a new place. Several days later, such an appropriate place was found, an island named Lust Elant (Pleasure Island), and on May 16, 1703 (Pentecost Sunday) the fortress was established there and was named St. Petersburg.;;;;;;;;;;;;

One is hard-pressed to find a thicker froth of wretchedness and bestiality. However, these pirate havens do turn quite a profit, and if kept in check, it may even be in our favour to let them be as perform their trade in wicked peace.

He was likely paid to shut down our legistlation, we could either respect his right to veto or try to bribe him behind the scenes.;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC176900;Muhammad Ali Pasha al-Mas'ud ibn Agha, known as Muhammad Ali of Egypt and the Sudan was the Albanian Ottoman governor and the de facto ruler of Egypt from 1805 to 1848, is considered the founder of modern Egypt. At the height of his rule, he controlled Lower Egypt, Upper Egypt, Sudan and parts of Arabia and the entire Levant. He attempted to modernize Egypt by instituting dramatic reforms in the military, economic and cultural spheres. He also initiated a violent purge of the Mamluks, consolidating his rule and permanently ending the Mamluk hold over Egypt.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC176901;Muhammad Ali's goal was for Egypt to leave the Ottoman Empire and be ruled by his own hereditary dynasty. To do that, he had to reorganize Egyptian society, streamline the economy, train a professional bureaucracy, and build a modern military. His first task was to secure a revenue stream for Egypt. To accomplish this, Muhammad Ali 'nationalized' all the iltizam lands of Egypt, thereby officially owning all the production of the land. He accomplished the state annexation of property by raising taxes on the 'tax-farmers' who had previously owned the land throughout Egypt. Beyond building a functioning, industrial economy, Muhammad Ali also made an effort to train a professional military and bureaucracy. He sent promising citizens to Europe to study. Again the driving impulse behind the effort was to build a European-style army. Students were sent to study European languages, primarily French, so they could in turn translate military manuals into Arabic. He then used both educated Egyptians and imported European experts to establish schools and hospitals in Egypt. European education also provided talented Egyptians with a means of social mobility. A by-product of Muhammad Ali's training program was the establishment of a professional bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC173200;By the late 17th century, the Iranian Safavids, like their arch rival the Ottoman Turks, had been starting to heavily decline due to misrule, sectarian strife, and foreign interests. In 1704, the Safavid Shah Husayn appointed his Georgian subject and king of Kartli George XI (Gurgin Khan), a convert to Islam, as the commander-in-chief of the easternmost provinces of the Safavid Empire, modern-day Afghanistan. His first task was to quell the uprisings in the region. Gurgin began imprisoning and executing Afghans, especially those suspected of organizing rebellions, successfully crushing them. One of those arrested and imprisoned was Mirwais, belonging to the influential Hotak family in the Kandahar region. Mirwais was sent as a prisoner to the Persian court in Isfahan, but Shah Husayn dismissed the charges against him, so he was sent back to his native land as a free man. Protected by the Ghaznavid Nasher Khans, Mirwais and his followers revolted against Safavid rule in Kandahar in April 1709.;;;;;;;;;;;;
