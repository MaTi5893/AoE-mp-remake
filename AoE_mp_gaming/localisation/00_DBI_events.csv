EVTNAME190401;The Mycenaean Excavations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC190401;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has requested excavation rights to look for the ruins of Mycenaean Greece. While we ourselves do not have the know how or money to fund a serious excavation of the area, and allowing a foreign contractor might be good for that reason, it might also be best to let the secrets of Egyptian history lie undisturbed until such a time when we ourselves can find them. Turning down a foreign power will spoil our relations and reduce their prestige, though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA190401;Go for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB190401;This is a violation of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ sovereignty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19041;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Grants Excavation Permit;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC190411;The government of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has granted us the right to excavate and investigate ancient ruins in Myceanean Greece. The potential discoveries there will prove an enormous opportunity for us to increase our scientific renown in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19042;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses Excavation Permit;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC190421;The government of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to allow us excavation rights in Myceanean Greece. Our international prestige has been lowered as a result, and relations with $FROMCOUNTRY$ have soured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19042;Bah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME190431;Myceanean Excavation Legal Issues;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC190431;There's been some unfortunate allegations in Greece about certain actions of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ excavation team...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA190431;A little money may help?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB190431;Bring them home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC17077;Delhi lies in a state of shock and mourning as word comes from the Deccan that Shahnshah Alamgir Aurangzeb has passed away from natural causes. During his tenure the Mughal empire reached a land area of 4 million sq kilometres and had a population of about 158 million. Yet despite all this Aurangzeb was hated by many. Having come to power after murdering his brothers and imprisoning his father, Aurangzeb deviated from previous Mughal policy regarding non-Islamic religions. He reimposed the Jizya tax, suppressed Hindus, Sikhs, Shias and other religions and aggressively waged war. He thus spent most of his reign conquering kingdoms and crushing the various rebellions, among them his own son Akbar's rebellion hurt the empire most. The last few decades of his reign were spent trying to crush the Marathas in the Deccan. When he arrived in the Deccan in 1690 he vowed to never return to Delhi till the Marathas were crushed. Fate was cruel and the Badshah never returned to Delhi. Until he was alive, he held together his huge and hated empire through his personal charishma and military brilliance. Now he has been laid to rest at Khuldabad in the Deccan. With no competent heir to the Mughal throne, a power game has started among the various regional Mansabdars(Governors) and to top it all, the Marathas and other rivals are ready to pounce on the weakened empire. India and the new Mughal Shahnshah Bahadur Shah face an uncertain and violent future now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But who will lead us? who can provide all these things? Now that we're independent this question have been on everyone's mind. There are a two best options: A republic with with a "president" as the head of state or a constitutional monarchy with a king at it's lead;;;;;;;;;;;;;
