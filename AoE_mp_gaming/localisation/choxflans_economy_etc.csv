EVTDESC420360;Although it brought no lava flow, the Heei eruption released some 800 million cubic metres of volcanic ash, which spread over vast areas around the volcano, even reaching Edo almost 100 kilometres away. Cinders and ash fell like rain in Izu, Kai, Sagami, and Musashi provinces. In Edo, the volcanic ash was several centimetres thick. The eruption is rated a 5 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index.;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC420361;The 1703 Apennine earthquakes were a sequence of three earthquakes of magnitude 6 and more that occurred in the central Apennines of Italy, over a period of 19 days. The epicenters were near Norcia, Montereale and L'Aquila, showing a southwards progression over about 36 km. These events involved all of the known active faults between Norcia and L'Aquila. A total of about 10,000 people are estimated to have died as a result of these earthquakes, although because of the overlap in areas affected by the three events, casualty numbers remain highly uncertain.;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC420362;The 1703 Genroku earthquake (Genroku Daijishin) occurred at 02:00 local time on December 31. The epicenter was near Edo, the forerunner of present-day Tokyo, in the southern part of the Kanto region, Japan. An estimated 2,300 people were killed by the shaking and subsequent fires. The earthquake triggered a major tsunami which caused many casualties, giving a total death toll of at least 5,233, possibly up to 10,000.;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC420363;The Great Storm of 1703 was a destructive extratropical cyclone that struck central and southern England on 26 November 1703. Ships were blown hundreds of miles off-course, and over 1,000 seamen died on the Goodwin Sands alone. News bulletins of casualties and damage were sold all over England – a novelty at that time. The Church of England declared that the storm was God's vengeance for the sins of the nation. Lamb (1991) claimed 10,000 seamen were lost in one night, a far higher figure, about one third of the seamen in the Royal Navy.;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC420364;The 1717 Guatemala earthquake struck Guatemala on September 29 with an estimated moment magnitude of 7.4, and a Mercalli intensity of approximately IX (Violent). The earthquake essentially destroyed much of the architecture of Antigua Guatemala, which was the colonial capital of Central America at the time. Over 3,000 buildings were ruined including many temples and churches. Such was the effect of the disaster that the authorities later moved the headquarters to a settlement which was less prone to natural disasters.;;;;;;;;x
christmas_flood;Christmas Flood's destruction;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC420365;In total, about 14,000 people drowned. It was the last large storm flood in the north of the Netherlands. Floodwaters reached the towns and cities of Groningen, Zwolle, Dokkum, Amsterdam, and Haarlem. Many villages near the sea were devastated entirely, such as in the west of Vlieland and villages behind the sea dykes in Groningen Province. The local communities had to cope with population loss, economic decline, and poverty. No area of the coast between the Netherlands and Denmark was spared. The worse-affected areas were in the County of Oldenburg, around Jever, Kehdingen, and the principality of East Frisia.;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC420366;The largest active volcano and the highest peak in Iceland at 2,110 metres (6,920 ft), it lies within the Vatnajökull National Park and is covered by the glacier. An eruption in August 1727-28 was smaller than 1362, though floods are known to have caused few fatalities when the meltwater swept a farm away.;;;;;;;;x
minor_flood;Minor Flood;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC420367;The 1721 Tabriz earthquake occurred on April 26, with an epicenter near the city of Tabriz. It leveled some three-quarters of the city, including many prominent mosques and schools in the city, and resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people. The total number of casualties caused by the earthquake is approximately 80,000. At the time that it occurred, the earthquake was popularly interpreted as an omen of misfortune, or a demonstration of godly wrath. The destruction that the earthquake caused was a significant factor in the successful Ottoman takeover of Tabriz in 1722, as well as contributing to Tabriz's economic difficulties during that period.;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC420368;The 1730 Valparaíso earthquake occurred at 04:45 local time on July 8. It had an estimated magnitude of 9.1–9.3 and triggered a tsunami. The earthquake caused severe damage over a wide area, Valparaiso, Coquimbo, Illapel, Petorca and Tiltil were all affected. The parish church in La Serena was destroyed. Only a few deaths were recorded due to the earthquake, reportedly because a strong foreshock had caused people to leave their homes. The same is also true for the following tsunami with the inhabitants running to higher ground after seeing the water recede, so that only a few were killed.;;;;;;;;x
