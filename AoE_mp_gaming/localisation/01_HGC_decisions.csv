support_january_uprising_desc;After Martial Law was declared, those designated for conscription secretly fled from Warsaw (Jan. 14–15, 1863), sought refuge in the nearby woodlands, and on January 22 issued a manifesto calling for a national insurrection. Although they were greatly outnumbered, poorly equipped, and successful in only a few engagements, the rebels gained support among the artisan, worker, lower gentry, and official classes in the cities and stimulated peasant revolts against the large landlords in rural areas.

russian_vladivostokSOV_desc;In July of 1860 the port of Vladivostok, or “Ruler of the East,” was founded near the Korean frontier.  It would become a major Russian trade port and shipbuilding yard. Eventually, it would become the focal point of an intercontinental railroad as well as a major scientific, cultural, and industrial center in its own right. The Czar dreamed that the city would become a hub connecting the west with the east. Perhaps the railroad to Vladivostok will eventually replace the Suez Canal as the bearer of goods and raw materials between the East and the West?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The changes included making the diet a regularly convening body, a promise which was kept by the Emperor when the diet convened again in January 1867. The result was greater Finnish Autonomy within the Russian Empire and a improvement in the relations of the Finnish Parliament and the Tsar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

switch_to_early_russian_tech_desc;Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality, also known as Official Nationality was the dominant ideological doctrine of Russian emperor Nicholas I. "The Triad" of Official Nationality was originally proposed by Minister of Education Sergey Uvarov in his April 2, 1833 circular letter to subordinate educators. It was soon embraced by Nicholas and his establishment and gained wide public recognition, vocally supported by intellectuals like Mikhail Pogodin, Fyodor Tyutchev and Nikolay Gogol. Critics of the policy saw this principle as a call for Russification. Yet the very fact of its existence, being Russia's first statewide political ideology since the sixteenth century, indicated the nation's brewing transition to modernity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This elite was divided into Slavophiles and Westernizers, according to their views on the path Russia should take in the future, and the social class they represented was called intelligentsia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

establish_ecole_militire_title;Establish Ecole Militaire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
establish_ecole_militire_desc;Founded in 1750 by King Louis XV, after the War of the Austrian Succession, on the basis of a proposal of Marshal Maurice de Saxe and with the support of Madame de Pompadour and financier Joseph Paris Duverney. Previously, military academies were exclusive to children of a noble background and offered apprenticeships in the King's Stables or the stables of other royal members. With the aim of creating an academic college for cadet officers from poor noble families, the exclusivity that royal military academies held vanished. By the edict of January 1751, King Louis XV founded the institution intended for the education of five hundred noble young men and born without fortune. Article XI of the edict provides for "by way of first perpetual endowment" the tax on playing cards. The administration is entrusted to the Secretary of State for War. The Royal Military Academy included a number of military colleges in the province such as the School of Brienne where students were admitted on evidence of nobility. At the end of their schooling, admission to the Royal Military School in Paris was done through a national competition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

edict_of_tolerance_desc;We have considered that the Protestants, thus deprived of all legal existence, were faced with an impossible choice between profaning the sacraments by simulated conversions or compromising the status of their children by contracting marriages that were inherently null and void according to the legislation of our kingdom. The regulations have even assumed that there were only Catholics in our states; and this fiction, today inadmissible, has served as a motive for the silence of the law which would not have been able to legally recognize followers of another belief in France without either banishing them from the lands of our authority or providing right away for their civil status. Principles so contrary to the prosperity and tranquility of our kingdom would have multiplied the emigrations and would have excited continual troubles within families, if we had not provisionally profited from the jurisprudence of our courts to thrust aside greedy relatives who contested the children's rights to the inheritance of their fathers relying on the laws against Calvinists]. Such a situation has for a long time demanded our intervention to put an end to these dangerous contradictions between the rights of nature and the dispositions of the law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Medina Sidonia was an aristocrat without naval command experience but was made commander by King Philip II. The aim was to overthrow Queen Elizabeth I and her establishment of Protestantism in England, to stop English interference in the Spanish Netherlands and to stop the harm caused by English and Dutch privateering ships that interfered with Spanish interests in the Americas. If we want to rebuild our might and prestige, renovating the Armada could be a great starting point to begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

introduce_the_goose_step_title;Introduce the Goose Step;;;;;;;;;;;;;
introduce_the_goose_step_desc;The goose step is a special marching step performed on formal military parades and other ceremonies. While marching in parade formation, troops swing their legs in unison off the ground while keeping each leg rigidly straight. The ""Stechschritt"" originated in the 18th century, like other march steps, as a method of keeping troops lined up properly as they advanced towards enemy lines. It was introduced into German military tradition by Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, a Field Marshal whose close attention to training transformed the Prussian infantry into one of the most formidable armed forces in Europe. Other armies adopted different march steps that served the same purpose; in the British Army, soldiers were trained to swing their arms in a wide arc to allow officers to keep the advancing line in order. The Russian Empire adopted the goose step during the 1796–1801 reign of Paul I.;;;;;;;;;;;;
regimental_cantons_title;Fund the Regimental cantons;;;;;;;;;;;;;
regimental_cantons_desc;Canton Regulation (Kantonreglement) was a system of recruitment used by the Prussian army between 1733 and 1813. The country was divided into recruiting districts called cantons (Kantone), and each canton was the responsibility of a regiment. The system was a Prussian distinctive. Every male was from the youngest possible age enrolled in the army, and by 1740 the Prussian army, with a strength of 3.6% of the total population, was proportionately the largest in Europe. The new system replaced coercive recruiting, which in turn replaced the hiring of undependable and expensive mercenary forces. It allowed the army to double from 38,000 to 76,000, making it the fourth largest in Europe, and it linked the local population more closely to the royal government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Unlike other Academies, the Prussian Academy was not directly funded out of the state treasury. Frederick granted it the monopoly on producing and selling calendars in Brandenburg, a suggestion from Leibniz. As Frederick was crowned "King in Prussia" in 1701, creating the Kingdom of Prussia, the Academy was renamed Königlich Preußische Sozietät der Wissenschaften (""Royal Prussian Society of Sciences""). While other Academies focused on a few topics, the Prussian Academy was the first to teach both sciences and humanities. In 1710, the Academy statute was set, dividing the Academy into two sciences and two humanities classes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hamiltons_tresury_reforms_desc;Governments at all levels had taken on so much debt during the Revolution. The commitment to pay them back was not taken very seriously. By the late 1780s, the value of such public securities had plunged to a small fraction of their face value. In other words, state IOU's — the money borrowed to finance the Revolution — were viewed as nearly worthless. Hamilton issued a bold proposal. The federal government should pay off all CONFEDERATION (state) debts at full value. Such action would dramatically enhance the legitimacy of the new central government. To raise money to pay off the debts, Hamilton would issue new SECURITIES bonds). Investors who had purchased these public securities could make enormous profits when the time came for the United States to pay off these new debts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

enact_the_table_of_ranks_title;Create the Table of Ranks;;;;;;;;;;;;;
enact_the_table_of_ranks_desc;The Table of Ranks re-organised the foundations of feudal Russian nobility (mestnichestvo) by recognising service in the military, in the civil service, and at the imperial court as the basis of an aristocrat's standing in society. The table divided ranks in 14 grades, with all nobles regardless of birth or wealth (at least in theory) beginning at the bottom of the table and rising through their service (sluzhba) to the Tsar. While all grades were open by merit, promotion required qualification for the next rank, and grades 1 through 5 required the personal approval of the Tsar himself. Despite initial resistance from noblemen, many of whom were still illiterate in the 18th century and who shunned the paper-pushing life of the civil servant, the eventual effect of the Table of Ranks was to create an educated class of noble bureaucrats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Pre-existing copper coins were halved in value and only the most recent silver coins retained their face values.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
gustav_iii_reforms_title;Gustav III's reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;;
gustav_iii_reforms_desc;The Riksdag of 1786 marks a turning-point in Gustav's history. Henceforth he showed a growing determination to rule without a parliament, a cautious and gradual passage from semi-constitutionalism to semi-absolutism. At the same time, his foreign policy became more adventurous. At first he sought to gain Russian support to acquire Norway from Denmark. When Catherine the Great refused to abandon her ally Denmark, Gustav declared war on Russia in June 1788, while it was deeply engaged in a war with the Ottoman Empire to the south. In embarking on a war of aggression without the consent of the estates, Gustav violated his own constitution of 1772, which led to a serious mutiny, the Anjala Conspiracy, among his aristocratic officers in Finland. Denmark declared war in support of its Russian ally, but was soon neutralized through British and Prussian diplomacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
